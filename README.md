# Archer

**[Archer](https://archer.inflmts.com)**
is a lightweight and performant alternative to the
[GNV RideRTS](https://riderts.app) app, with a focus on simplicity.
As such, many features are not implemented. Archer is intended for those who are
already familiar with the routes, and only care about when their bus is going to
arrive.

Archer is heavily inspired by [GNV Transit](https://gnvtransit.app) by
[Sam Claus](https://samcla.us) and [Kaley Ali](https://kaleya.li), although it
shares none of its code. Like GNV Transit, Archer still uses RTS's BusTime API
server (`https://riderts.app/bustime/api/v3`) hosted in Gainesville.

Development of Archer is still in the early stages, expect bugs and
inconsistencies between browsers. Archer uses many modern browser features, so
it may not work on older browsers.
